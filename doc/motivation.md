### Motivation

injesta is a serious hobby project. The principle motivation is to provide its author with the opportunity to learn about the development of Erlang applications.

The author has, for some time, been involved in the development and support of high throughput data ingest applications. These are applications that read streams of data from a range of sources, parse, transform, normalise and filter the data and then load it into a database and make it available for query.

injesta is a research project to explore the suitability of Erlang for such data ingest applications.
